# D* lite vs LSS-RTA*

## Incremental algorithm for path planning in a dynamic environment

### D* lite


The D* Lite algorithm was developed by Sven Koenig and Maxim Likhachev for a faster and easier alternative to the D* algorithm (developed by Anthony Stentz in 1995).  

Here is an implementation of D\*Lite as provided in the article in [Koenig, 2002](http://idm-lab.org/bib/abstracts/papers/aaai02b.pdf)
